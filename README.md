- 👋 Hi, I’m @ghdoc
- 👀 I’m interested in usual computer-science stuff, big data, ML, NLP stuff, but most importantly integration of various services, automation and minimalism.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - not gonna cause an overflow on github by writing this.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now.
- 📫 How to reach me - I will reach you if needed.
